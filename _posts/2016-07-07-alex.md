# First post

Well this is new. My first real web site. What do you guys want to talk about?

I could break the ice with a famous quote or a funny joke, but I'm not sure that would suit my personality terribly well. This is my first post and nothing is more cliche than starting off a personal blog using someone else's words. It's probably not a bad way to get a few hits on Google though; maybe I'll throw in a quote at the end...

Don't get me wrong, I don't have any grand delusions of my personal blog bringing me fame or fortune. But it would be nice to know that there are some people out there who are interested in some of the same things that I am interested in. In fact, unlike most people who start websites or blogs, I don't really have a grand scheme. More than anything, my goal for this site is just to act as an introduction.

> Hello. My name is Alex. I am an IT engineer working for a company that makes video games. I have a dog, my own server lab, and a fiancée.

Now, before you start to wonder if I intentionally placed my dog and my servers before my fiancée in my previous statement, I will just tell you that I did. I intentionally listed them in DESCENDING order of neediness. But I'll get more into that later.
